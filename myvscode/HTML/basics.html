    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <script>
        // This is a JavaScript function definition, we need to use the "function" keyword
        // Functions are awesome - you write code 1 time and can reuse it throughout your program
        // Functions help organize code
        // Function names should usually be some sort of action
        // Alawys include the () - sometimes there be variable(s) in between the () or they may be empty
        // Always make sure there are a matching set of {}
        function runCalc(){ // Donot mix ; and {}
            // Whatever code is inbetween the curly braces belongs to this function
            // We will create a variable called num1, and we will give it a default value of 0
            // JavaScript should assume this is a numeric datatype
            var num1 = 0;
            var num2 = 0;

            // We want to promp the user for  anumer, using the built in JavaScript prompt function
            // The prompt function takes an argument (variable) - the text that will be shown to the user with the prompt
            // The prompt function returns the value that the user entered in
            // Set the num1 variable equal to the value the user entered in
            num1 = prompt("Please enter number 1:"); // Most lines of JavaScript need a ; at the end 
            num2 = prompt("Please enter number 2:"); // Get another number from the user and assign it to the num2 variable

            // Lets add num1 and num2 together and store that value in the total variable
            // The built in JavaScript function parseInt makes sure that JavaScript treats the num1 and num2 variables as integers
            var total = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2);

            // Call the built in JavaScript function called alert - this will show a message to the user
            // It should show our numbers and the total
            alert("The total of " + num1 + " plus " + num2 + " is " + total);
        }

        // We have created the function, now we need to call it so that the function code will run
        // The () are blank because we dont need to pass any information into this function
        runCalc();
        // console.log(num1, num2);

        // The code here does not belong to the function
